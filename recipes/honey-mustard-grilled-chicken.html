    <h4>3 Finished chicken breast arranged in a plate</h4>
    <p>The marinade /sauce flavors really absorb itself into the chicken, and I let the flavors set in for a mere half-hour before grilling! 
        The chicken turned out absolutely delicious. I grilled each breast for approx. 4 minutes on each side. They turned out perfect. 
        I then basted them again w/leftover mixture and let them sit on the grill an extra minute before taking them in for consumption. 
        This recipe is definitely a keeper!</p>
