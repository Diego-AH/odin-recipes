    <h4>Finished tuna in plate</h4>
    <p>This is a really simple recipe, how it "turns out" depends largely on the quality of your ingredients.
        If you had a great piece of fish and a seasoning blend that you really liked, it could be a GREAT recipe. Simple, easy, quick. Great for a summer night. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds of fresh tuna steaks, 1 inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously coat tuna steaks on both sides with Cajun seasoning.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking.</li>
        <li>Arrange tuna steaks in the skillet and cook until blackened on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes.
            Flip and cook until desired doneness is reached, 3 to 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare.
